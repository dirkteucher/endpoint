// This is where I would normally place a global style guide from a framework or a custom built set of controls.
// So that from this file large sweeping changes could be made across the site globally
// For the purpose of this example and as there is only a single file I have left this out
// Great example of a style guide UI - https://codepen.io/guide
// Example of framework theme generation - https://vuetifyjs.com/en/theme-generator
